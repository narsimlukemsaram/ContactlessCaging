Abstract—Biological transport strategies in ants, such as cooperative pushing, pulling, and caging, have inspired novel approaches in swarm robotics. These behaviors demonstrate efficiency for transporting shared payloads. By translating these principles to swarm robotics, we explore how collective acoustic fields can enable similar transport without physical contact. We present ContactlessCaging, a bio-inspired robotic system for contactless caging and cooperative transport using a swarm of acoustic robots. This system comprises four TurtleBot3 robots, each equipped with an 8×8 phased array of transducer board, driven by an FPGA board using the UDP protocol (via an ESP32 Feather V2 board). A decentralized ROS 2 framework enables each robot to compute and synchronize local phase and amplitude patterns to generate an acoustic cage collectively. This dynamic pressure-based field traps and moves the lightweight particles in mid-air. Experiments carried out in simulated and controlled laboratory settings confirm the successful establishment of a stable acoustic cage. The distributed control scheme maintains synchronization within 1.9 microseconds, ensuring the formation of a coherent acoustic field. The swarm autonomously adjusts its formation geometry to maintain trapping stability and adapt to the transport of the particle. The results confirm that acoustic-based caging can emulate biological cooperative transport, achieving contactless, scalable manipulation through distributed acoustic actuation. By embedding stigmergic coordination within a swarm of mobile phased arrays, this work establishes a foundation for next-generation acoustophoretic swarm systems capable of performing collective, non-invasive manipulation in complex environments.
